## Automating File Commits to a GitHub Repository from a Web Application

### Scenario

Our application's backend, located at @/app/api/generate-broadcast/route.ts, utilizes several public GitHub repositories for context, including:

-   `juanjaragavi/topfinanzas-ac-email-templates`
-   `juanjaragavi/topfinanzas-ac-image-email-templates`
-   `juanjaragavi/emailgenius-winner-broadcasts-subjects`

We need to implement a feature that allows files to be added to the `juanjaragavi/emailgenius-winner-broadcasts-subjects` repository directly from a file upload button within our application's user interface.

### Technical Inquiry

What is the recommended approach or architecture for programmatically creating and committing files to a GitHub repository in response to a user-triggered event in a web application?

We are considering using GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools, but are seeking the most efficient and secure method for this integration. The primary goal is to establish a workflow where a file uploaded via our app's front end is automatically pushed as a new commit to the specified repository.
